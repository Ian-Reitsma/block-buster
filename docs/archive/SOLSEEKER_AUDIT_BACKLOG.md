# Legacy SolSeeker Audit Backlog (Archived)

The SolSeeker audit notes referenced legacy `web/public/**` assets and FastAPI-era tooling. These no longer match the first-party dashboard/server stack. Archived on 2026-02-04 to avoid spec drift.

- Source: previous `AGENTS-AUDIT.md` lines ~61 and ~194.
- Current truth: see `AGENTS.md`, `ZERO_DEPENDENCIES_MIGRATION.md`, `RUNNING_FIRST_PARTY_SERVER.md`, and `web/public/dashboard_api_audit.md`.

If a task here becomes relevant again, rewrite it against the current stack and move it back into `AGENTS.md`.
