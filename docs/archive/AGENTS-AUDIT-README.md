# SolSeeker Audit Backlog (Archived)

This file and its companion `AGENTS-AUDIT-2025.md` described the pre-Block-Buster React/TypeScript + FastAPI dashboard work. The modern stack is first-party only (see `RUNNING_FIRST_PARTY_SERVER.md` and `ZERO_DEPENDENCIES_MIGRATION.md`) and uses `web/public/**` purely as static assets. The SolSeeker audit backlog is **archived** as of 2026-02-04. Do not treat the legacy API/task list as current requirements; instead follow the live backlog in `AGENTS.md` and the dashboard wiring map in `web/public/dashboard_api_audit.md`.

If any item from the old backlog is still relevant, port it into the current documents under `docs/` and delete it here. Until then, keep this file for historical reference only.
